# Period-Ambiguity-Dataset
Cordial pleasure to reach out our project dataset where we founded the data to resolve the Period Ambiguity with the machine learning techniques and we got the beneficial outcome from here. This is publicly useable to make this sector more better and use them for educational purpose. Hopefully this will make advantages for explorartion. 

# Description
This repository focuses on resolving ambiguities in terminal punctuation, specifically the accurate identification of periods in English linguistic processing. Periods, while seemingly straightforward, can represent sentence boundaries, abbreviations, or numerical decimals, making their interpretation crucial for natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as tokenization, parsing, and text summarization. Leveraging cutting-edge machine learning techniques, this project introduces innovative methods to disambiguate period usage, ensuring higher accuracy in linguistic modeling. The repository includes:

- **Dataset**: A curated corpus with annotated examples of periods in diverse contexts, including abbreviations, decimal points, and sentence termination.
- **Algorithms**: Implementation of state-of-the-art machine learning models, such as decision trees, SVMs, and deep learning architectures, optimized for punctuation disambiguation.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Rigorous testing using precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance across various linguistic domains.
- **Applications**: Insights into how this approach enhances downstream NLP tasks like sentiment analysis, machine translation, and automated summarization.
- This repository is designed to serve as a foundational resource for researchers, developers, and linguists interested in enhancing the precision of English text processing using machine learning.
